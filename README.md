# bscardgame-team6
A Java based implementation of the B.S. card game

## Environment Setup
You will need the following to compile and run this game

* NetBeans 8.2
* Java SE 1.8 (Runtime + JDK)

After cloning the repository, open the project folder under NetBeans > Open Project. This will import the project into NetBeans where you can Clean, Build, and finally Run. 

## Server setup
Runtime is the same as the Environment Setup above. Machine running the server project will need to open port ranges for communication over the internet with the clients.

## Download and run client binary (JAR)
We have a precompiled binary packaged in a JAR which uses our hosted game server available under [Releases](https://github.com/CS-SE6356-2/a1-007-team-6/releases)
